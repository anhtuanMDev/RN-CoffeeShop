#Creator
This project is inspired by [C O D E X](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1Co2M-gsQE).The project's UI will have some adjustments and changes for better usability and new features during the development process. While the UI/UX will bear similarities to the inspiration, the back end will be uniquely developed to meet the specific requirements and goals of the RN-CoffeeShop project.

The back-end system will be built from the ground up using Node.js and Express.js, ensuring it is tailored to efficiently handle the needs of our application, including order management, inventory tracking, and real-time updates. This custom back-end will be integrated with MongoDB for robust data storage and retrieval, ensuring a seamless and responsive user experience.
